Mariam Machaidze's internship projects and working progress.

to do:
 - If the resistor broke in the inside, it means one of the resistors can be RV01. I want to see what happens in this case.
 - Finish making recursion

28 July:
 - I am working on finilizing recurion solution.
   - First, I need to finish making good looking data. file - making perimeter. - finished this.
   - I made partially working recursion model. It still needs improvment.
     1. consider connection resistor to be broken.
     2. consider n > 4 higher grid
     3. returning answer looking like HV11.

26 July:
 - I figured out how to make recursion of the even-noded-side grid.

To test NxN_grid_working_code, first we need to think about which n we want to use. For example, n = 10.

Step 1. Create a dataset for 10x10 grid
- For this we need to open making_dataset.py file and change the value of n to 10 and run the code. Wait for the file to be fully created.

Step 2. Run the code.
- Open NxN_grid_working_code file and change the value of n to 10 and tun the code. When everything is run, there shouldn't be errors in the code if everything is working. The last code shouldn't print anything if the code is working well.

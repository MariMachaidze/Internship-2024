Every file here has its own purpose.

The following files do following:
1. reading - I tried out some DataFrame functions
2. failed way to make perimeter - I liked the idea how it would work but I'm giving up on this for a while (might come back later)
3. visualization - some data visualization which helped me find some symmetries
4. voltages on nodes - I looked at the voltages on nodes and looked at which one decreased and increased
5. filtering_and_ordering - first version of making perimeter data
6. downloading - trying some stuff in python.
7. data_append_version - trying append
8. Data visualization and predictions - good version of making perimeter data + some data visualization, symmetries and prediction


9. making perimeter - combination of all good versions of making perimeter. It reads data from voltages in every node and returns perimeter.

I will finish writing this later...
